A simple wrapper around git-http-backend and GitWeb, providing an extremely lightweight way to host
a web-browsable Git repository.

You can connect through your Git client to pull or push, and you can connect through your web browser
to search file contents and explore revision history.

You can also push to a special branch named `gw-pages` in order to publish its
static contents at a public grain URL.
